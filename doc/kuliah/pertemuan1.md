3. coordinates
Coordinates is something that shows the location of the point of his earth by latitude and longitude. There are no coordinates Latitude and Longitude.
So there is a point of coordinates (0,0) and point 00 it is in the UK where it is in Greenwetch. Below is an example image coordinates.
  


 
  
Conclusion
We should know in advance where the location coordinates of 00 points and must understand how to use the GIS application
Suggestion
 
Furthermore, we have to practice it on the GIS.
